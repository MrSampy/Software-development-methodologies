# Instruction, how to build and run .NET project
To build and run a .NET project, you need to follow these steps:

- Install the .NET SDK on your computer. You can download it from the official .NET website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download (.NET 6.0)

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your project.

- Run the dotnet restore command to install all the project dependencies from the internet or local NuGet caches.

- Run the dotnet build command to compile the project and create the executable file. If the project is successfully compiled, the executable file will be located in the bin/Debug or bin/Release folder, depending on the build mode.

- If your project is a console application, you can run it using the dotnet run command. If your project has an executable file, you can run it by executing the file from the command prompt or double-clicking on it in the file explorer.
